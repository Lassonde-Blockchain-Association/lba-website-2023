# Instructions for contrubutors

Hello there! here are some instructions on how to start coding for the website.

## Getting Started

As a first step that you only have to do once, clone the repo to your local machine. You can either use `SSH` (recommended) or `HTTPS` address for cloning.

Here are the steps to do it:
1. Navigate to the folder you want to clone the repo in.
2. Open your terminal and type:
    - For SSH (recommended): `git clone git@github.com:Lassonde-Blockchain-Club/lba-website-2023.git`
    - For HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/Lassonde-Blockchain-Club/lba-website-2023.git`

### Some resources to solve errors while setting up SSH:

This will clone the main branch of the Lassonde Blockchain Association Website repo to your local machine.

Next steps are below.

## Branching

In Lassonde Blockchain Association website 2023 create a new branch under your name:
- `git checkout -b your-own-branch-name` - To create a new branch and move to it. For eg: `git checkout -b Natalie`
- `git branch` - To check which branch you are on
- `git checkout your-own-branch-name` - To move to your branch. For eg: `git checkout Natalie`

You will see your section branch when you are ready to push (`Teams`, `Mission`, `Footer`, `Landing`  etc.)

## Contributing

Start coding! when you are ready to push, in the terminal type:
- `git add .` - to add all the changes you made
- `git commit -m "update information”` - to commit the changes you made
- `git push origin your-own-branch-name` - to push the changes to your branch.For e.g: `git push origin Natalie`

Let us know when you push!

Once you finishes all the tasks on ur sections --> `merge` to `Section-Branch`

And as always, let us know if you have any questions!
